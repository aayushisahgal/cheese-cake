HOW TO CREATE A PERFECT CHEESECAKE?

I love cheesecake but not those dense bricks you find at some restaurants, for me a cheesecake should have a light fluffy texture and an nice balance of sweet and tangy. The crust had to have a nice crunch and depth of flavor so I add toasted pecans into the mix and it makes all the difference! A cracked cheesecake is still delicious but I prefer a cheesecake with a beautiful unblemished surface.

This creamy, fluffy cheesecake recipe is perfectly sweet with a light and delicate texture, all wrapped in a crunchy Graham cracker and toasted pecan crust. Getting the perfect no crack bake is easier than you think and the end result is so beautiful it almost doesn't need any topping!
