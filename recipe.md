RECIPE:
 1) Add the Graham crackers, toasted pecans, salt, sugar and cinnamon to a food processor fitted with a blade attachment. Pulse until broken into a fine meal.

 2)Drizzle the melted butter in while pulsing. Remove blade and use a spatula to finish mixing in the butter.

 3)Transfer the crust to the springform pan. Use a tall glass to tamp it down and to the side. The more you compact the crust the better it will cut after baking so give it a nice press. Bake at 350F for about 10 minutes or until it just begins to brown.

 4)Cream the room temperature cream cheese, sugar and salt together until smooth. I’m using a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment but this can be done with a hand mixer as well.

 5)Add in the room temperature sour cream and beat until completely combined then scrape the bowl down.

 6) Add the eggs and yolks one at a time allowing each to incorporate before adding the next then toss in that vanilla.

 7) Sprinkle in the flour while the mixer is running on low. Scrape down the bowl really well and then miix until batter is totally smooth.

 8) Pour the batter into your partially baked crust. The filling will not really rise during the bake so you can pour to almost the top. I wrapped my pan in foil because I was going to baking in a water bath but it turned out not to be needed.  Bake at 350F for 20 minutes then reduce temperature to 300F and continue baking to 40 minutes. Leave the oven door closed for an hour after baking and then you can remove from the oven. This cake is best chilled so if possible make it a day ahead.

 PRO TIPS TO MAKE THE BEST CHEESECAKE RECIPE~~~
 
 Start off with really room temperature cream cheese. Leave it out the night before or zap it in the microwave for 20 seconds at 50% power. If the cream cheese is too firm the batter will not be smooth.

 Beat the cream cheese and sugars until completely smooth.

 No Graham crackers? No problem! Sub in your favorite cookie like Biscoff or Digestives.

 If you’re cursed with cracking then bake in a water bath and leave that oven closed for an hour after turning off and before removing. Slow and steady wins the race for a nice smooth uncracked cheesecake.

 Try not to open the oven, the rush of cold air into the oven will not be good for your delicate cake.

 Don’t be frightened if your cheesecake seems underdone after an hour of baking, it will firm up.

 When you wrap the cheesecake up Have a piece of paper towel under the plastic or foil. This will absorb condensation and your surface will be unmarred by water droplets.
